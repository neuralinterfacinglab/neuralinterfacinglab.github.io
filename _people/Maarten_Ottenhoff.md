#### Research interests
How is movement represented throughtout the brain? And can we decode it for the use of brain-computer interfaces? These are the main question Maarten wants to answer. Currently working as a postdoc, Maarten aims to build closed-loop motor decoders based on brain-wide movement-related neural activity.

#### Biography
Throughout his life, Maarten has always been fascinated by human movement. What started with finding the limits of his own movement with track & field on national level, has now grown in to a deep passion in understanding and decoding how humans control movement. With his background in human movement science (bachelor) and artificial intelligence (master), Maarten finds himself at the perfect intersection of both the biological and technical aspect of the motor decoding field. After finishing his PhD in motor decoding from brain-wide areas, he received the Kootstra Talent Fellowship to translate his gained knowledge into closed-loop motor decoders as a postdoc.
